#!/bin/bash
#
# /user/local/bin/rsync.backup
#
#
# Usage:
#    Run as a 'session-setup-script' in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
# That will then rsync the directories given in: ~/bin/$USER.backup
# to a local net rsync server at the given ip address (see below).
#
# Note 1:
#    Will not backup /root files to avoid roots sensitive keys
# to be backed up to a common server (potentially may be retrived)
#
# Note2:
#    Any users private keys will be backed if directory is $HOME,
# unless exclude options is set to not backup '~/.ssh'
#
# Note3:
#    Set mode of this file too 0700 (root can execute/read this)
