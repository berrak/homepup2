# Script to: 
#               1. partition the usb flash - assumed correctly detected
#               2. format usb flash to ext3 file system

#
# Assumptions:  a) Searches only for all disk devices in /dev/sd*
#               b) System disk is /dev/sda (which may not be
#                  true for Raids). Newer touch /dev/sda.
#               c) Does not handle multiple devices sdb, sdc, sdd
#               d  Does not know about old /dev/hd* scheme.
#
#     TODO: more safety checks to partition/format the right device.
