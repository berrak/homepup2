#
# Requirements: Debian package rsync (aptitude install rsync)
#
# Script is sourced by '/usr/local/bin/rsync.backup' if installed
# and executed when a user login with lightdm (GUI login).
# See: /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf were above script is referred.
#
# Usage:
# Automatically backup listed directories to server at every login
# Content will be backed up to warp:/srv/backup/<hostname>/bekr/home
#
# Notes:
#     Use a space separated list of full paths to directory to backup.
#
#     Note also that directories are backed up recursively by default.
#
#     Path with a trailing slash will backup files direct in that di-
#     rectory (i.e. no sub directory will be created below /home)
#
#     This is NOT normally what you want since:
#     1) all files ends up in the backup root ('/home)'
#     2) this will backup everything (also /bekr/nfs share). 
#
#     Todo: Use of user exclude that prevents e.g. nfs to be included.
#
#     Full paths should be given like /home/bekr (i.e. $HOME)

#------------------------------------------------------------
# List of sub directories to backup. $HOME/ will backup
# (recursive) everything in your home directory. Note slash.
# In other words if you like to have the last directory as a
# sub directory at target - leave the slash out in your path.
