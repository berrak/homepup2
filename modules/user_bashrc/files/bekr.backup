#
# Usage:
# Automatically backup listed directories to server at every login
# Content will be backed up to warp:/srv/backup/<hostname>/bekr/home
#
# Notes:
#     Use a space separated list of full paths to directory to backup.
#     If using a trailing slash only files in that directory will be
#     backed up (i.e. no sub directory will be created below /home.
#
#     Note also that directories are backed up recursive by default.
#
#     This is NOT normally what you want since all files messes up
#     at the backup root /home and you would backup everything below
#     (home/bekr (inclusive the nfs share). 
#
#     Todo: Use of user exclude that prevents e.g. nfs to be included.
#
#     Below directories starts at /home/bekr (i.e. $HOME)
